  goal: "1000 Pitches invites you to throw away your preconceptions of who can be an innovator and pitch your $1000 idea. "
  one_liner: "Our annual two-month long pitch competition that empowers students across campus to realize their innovative potential."
  description:
   - "1000 Pitches is a two month long pitch competition where top pitchers in each of 12 categories win $1000. Participants submit short video recordings of themselves pitching any idea (yes, ANY idea!) to our pitch gallery, and winners are chosen by industry professionals. Spark SC started the USC branch of 1000 Pitches in Fall 2014, and collected 1015 pitches! The event was founded at the University of Michigan in 2007 and has since expanded to 5 universities across the US. "
   - "The competition kicks off with an exciting opening ceremony to explain the game and showcase a few live examples. While we encourage students to pitch from home using our website, we also host Pitch Booths about two days a week throughout the course of the competition! Students can stop by these booths to submit pitches for treats and receive our (quite popular) 1000 Pitches TShirt! When the competition ends, we host a closing ceremony, where winning pitches are revealed and $1000 checks are distributed."
   - "Spark SC believes amazing ideas are out there –– scribbled on post-its, typed up on Notes, or tucked away in minds. 1000 Pitches invites us to throw away our preconceptions of who can be an “innovator” and adopt the belief that everyone has a thousand dollar pitch."
   - "Send us a note at hello@sparksc.org to find out how your organization can sponsor!"

  description:
   - "Arts, Grooves, & Foods is a music festival juxtaposed with a student talent exposition buzzing with an electric excitement."
   - "The initiative was born from an urge to inform the masses that entrepreneurship is more than starting companies and the desire to unite the talented students of USC’s diverse disciplines. Seemingly disparate goals? Not upon further investigation."
   - "By seeking out individuals working on creative and exciting projects in fields not traditionally linked to entrepreneurship, showcasing their brilliant work, and connecting the underlying entrepreneurial dots for participants and attendees alike, we were able to expose students of Viterbi, Annenberg, Dornsife, Roski, and others to the inspiring work of their Trojan peers and spread the message that the heart of entrepreneurship lies in creativity and self empowerment rather than LLCs and funding sprees."
   - "Arts, Grooves, & Foods is an event, but more than that, it is a movement for which we foresee burgeoning growth and far reaching impact."

   - "Our 'tech tourists' get to see companies’ working environments, learn about their initiatives, and meet individuals who love and influence their missions. On a given Tech Tour, we will load up a few cars in the morning and see about 3 companies throughout the course of the day. Viewing multiple companies per trip lets us compare cultures and projects and helps us to better paint the picture of LA tech as a whole."

They provided a coworking space where hackers could meet up, hear about eachothers ideas and start on new projects together."
   - "Now, we have adopted a new idea of a USC Hackers community, where hack nights and shared projects are an implication of the community we are trying to form, rather than an end result. We kick off the year with a USC Hackers Orientation event, where freshman learning computer science, or anyone else who is new to developing can mingle, view projects made at past hackathons, and hear about the hacker events, workshops and mentorship opportunities.Then, throughout the year, members of the community are encouraged to attend hackathons and other tech events together and rep the USC Hacker’s swag! We are proud to be trojan hackers and so excited to get building together!"
