  goal: "1000 Pitches invites you to throw away your preconceptions of who can be an innovator and pitch your $1000 idea. "
  one_liner: "Our annual two-month long pitch competition that empowers students across campus to realize their innovative potential."
  description:
   - "1000 Pitches is a two month pitch competition that energizes entrepreneurial thinking at USC. Participants share any idea they might have—yes, any idea—in a short video pitch that’s shared to the USC community through the 1000 Pitches Facebook page. Unlike most pitch competitions, 1000 Pitches does not seek highly prepared presentations. Instead, students spontaneously share their pitch at a “pitch booth” set up somewhere on campus in exchange for a super-soft, super comfy T-Shirt. This approach lets us target the general USC student population, who may not already be familiar with entrepreneurial thinking, and make an impact that reaches all corners of campus."
   - "Spark SC started the USC branch of 1000 Pitches in Fall 2014, and we’ve continued the tradition in the Fall of 2015 and 2016. Every year of the competition so far, we’ve exceeded our goal of collecting one thousand pitches."
   - "We believe amazing ideas are out there—scribbled on a sticky note, typed up in a notes app, or incubating in a brain. 1000 Pitches invites students to discard their preconceptions of who can be an entrepreneur and believe that everyone has an idea worth sharing."
   - "Send us a note at hello@sparksc.org to find out how your organization can sponsor!"

By exposing students of engineering, communication, business, sciences, art and design, and others to the inspiring work of their Trojan peers, we can spread the message that the spirit of entrepreneurship lies in creativity and self empowerment, beyond simply starting a company."

Rockets are matched with relatable mentors who share their interests and passions, and each mentor also has professional experience in their mentee’s areas of interest."

We equip the Rockets with a variety of tools, from hard skills like coding, designing and video editing, to soft skills like working in teams, ideating and sending professional emails. We empower our mentees to be lifelong learners, and promote a growth mindset to help the Rockets learn new skills and tackle difficult challenges in the future."
   - "Project Launch is supported and funded entirely through crowdfunding and corporate sponsors. If you are interested in learning more about this exceptional initiative, please send us an email at hello@sparksc.org."

   - "Our 'tourists' get to see companies’ working environments, learn about their initiatives, and meet the individuals who make it all work. On a given Safari in Los Angeles, we will load up a few cars in the morning and see one to three companies in a day. Viewing multiple companies per trip lets us compare cultures and projects and helps us to better paint the picture of LA tech as a whole."
   - "Each semester, we also organize a trip from Los Angeles to the San Francisco Bay Area, where students tour startups and other organizations in the Silicon Valley."

We kick off the year with a USC Hackers Orientation event, where freshman learning computer science, or anyone else who is new to developing can mingle, view projects made at past hackathons, and hear about the hacker events, workshops and mentorship opportunities.Then, throughout the year, members of the community are encouraged to attend hackathons and other tech events together and rep the USC Hacker’s swag! We are proud to be trojan hackers and so excited to get building together!"
