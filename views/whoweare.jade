        p.description Spark SC is uniquely structured to make sure we're focusing on projects we're passionate about. Originally a small but mighty group of 6, we expanded into the Spark SC Board. Students apply each semester to be a part of the team and work on Committees that excite them. Applications open at the beginning of each USC semester. Interested? Check out our recruitment page.
